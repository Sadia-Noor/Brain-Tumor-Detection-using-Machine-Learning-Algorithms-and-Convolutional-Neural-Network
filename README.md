# Brain Tumor Detection using ML & CNN

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on the early detection of brain tumors using machine learning (ML) algorithms and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The project utilizes a dataset of MRI images and integrates advanced ML techniques with deep learning to achieve accurate tumor detection.

## Key Features
- Implementation of traditional ML models including SVM, Random Forest, KNN, and more.
- Development of a CNN model for image classification.
- Dataset preprocessing techniques such as data augmentation and normalization.
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Comparison of performance between ML and CNN approaches.
- Comprehensive documentation covering methodology, results, and analysis.

## Motivation
Brain tumors pose a significant health risk, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to explore the capabilities of ML and CNN techniques in accurately identifying brain tumors from MRI images. By leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms and methodologies, we strive to contribute to the ongoing research in medical image analysis and improve patient outcomes.
